# Zach's Dotfiles

Because I need them somewhere.

## Installation

There's a really simple install script in `meta/install.sh` that links
the things in a list into your homedir. 

    $ git clone https://github.com/justjake/Dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

Print out the list of installable configurations:

    $ ~/.dotfiles/meta/install.sh

I usually install like this:

    $ zsh ~/.dotfiles/meta/install.sh dotfiles submodules ssh-config

## Configuration

Type `hostsettings` to edit your configuration file for this host.

Type `globalsettings` to edit the global zshrc

## Vim

Vim uses Vundle for plugin management.

Vim will complain loudly if you don't have Vundle.vim going. Make sure you `git
submodule init` or install with submodules before trying to use it, or download
and extract an archive of Vundle.vim to ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.

Once you launch Vim for the first time, type `:BundleInstall` to get all the
nifty vim plugins.
